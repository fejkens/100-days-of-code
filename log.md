# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 12th February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have gone through some excercises on freeCodeCamp and stopped just at the beginning of the Bootstrap section.

**Thoughts** Amazing how much you can go through if you just sit down and focus. I have a rough plan for my project which I will be building as I learn Web Development. It will be a football website where at the very beginning I will just have some info about each Premier League club. I have loads of ideas for the future that will allow me to practice loads of different things. I am very happy with this idea as I feel that it will allow me to implement pretty much anything that I learn into one big project.
