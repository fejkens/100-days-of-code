# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 12th February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have gone through some excercises on freeCodeCamp and stopped just at the beginning of the Bootstrap section.

**Thoughts** Amazing how much you can go through if you just sit down and focus. I have a rough plan for my project which I will be building as I learn Web Development. It will be a football website where at the very beginning I will just have some info about each Premier League club. I have loads of ideas for the future that will allow me to practice loads of different things. I am very happy with this idea as I feel that it will allow me to implement pretty much anything that I learn into one big project.

### Day 2: 13th February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started my project, created a basic team overview page with some information about the club. Completed only a couple freeCodeCamp challenges

**Thoughts**: Only an hour as there is a match that I want to watch!

### Day 3: 14th February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added some form fields to my website (Text input, radio buttons, checkboxes) and completed all freeCodeCamp challenges until I got to the Tribute page project.

### Day 4: 15th February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Attended my first freeCodeCamp meetup.

**Thoughts**: Met some very nice people and got some useful tips to take home!

### Day 5: 16th February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: An off day, could not concentrate - just a normal Friday! Completed some challenges on beta.freecodecamp.com.

**Thoughts**: I like that there are a lot of CSS exercices on the beta, although the editor does not look very appealing.

### Day 6: 17th February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Very good day, completed the tribute page challenge on freeCodeCamp and started creating my portfolio! Started the free trial on Team Treehouse, seems a bit more fast-paced, but enjoying it so far!

**Thoughts**: Felt like I knew what I was doing for the first time!

### Day 7: 18th February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had to play around with the navbar on my portfolio, added the social logos in the footer (Need to get them right tomorrow!) and watched some videos on Team Treehouse. Not very productive, but got a bit done. Need to finish my portfolio tomorrow and them work on making it responsive.

**Thoughts**: Enjoying the portfolio challenge, although CSS is a bit of a pain.

### Day 8: 19th February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had to stop after an hour due to a small house emergency. Learned a bit about CSS Grid, will try to use it on my portfolio tomorrow!

**Thoughts**: Loving CSS Grid so far

### Day 9: 20th February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Used everything that I know about CSS Grid on my portfolio and made it responsive. Removed the animations from the images on small size screens and continued with @perborgen's CSS Grid tutorial

**Thoughts**: Having fun learning CSS Grid!

### Day 10: 21st February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished my portfolio! Obviously, there aren't any projects on it so I have just put some placeholders, but I am quite proud of it. It's very simple but I have managed to make it almost fully responsive (Except for the menu!).

**Thoughts**: JavaScript tomorrow, very excited!

**Thoughts**: Hoping for a better day tomorrow.
